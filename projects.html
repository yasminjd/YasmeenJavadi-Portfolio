                                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Rocket is a full-stack web application that automates the resume-building process using AI and LaTeX. Users can upload their existing resume or start from scratch, and the system intelligently parses, tailors, and compiles job-ready resumes using professional templates. The project was designed to eliminate the repetitive, time-consuming task of customizing resumes for each job. By combining GPT-4 with structured templates, Rocket significantly reduces resume creation time while improving quality and personalization.</p>
