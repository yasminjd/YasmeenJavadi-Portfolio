                                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Stya is a mobile app that acts as an AI-powered personal stylist. Users upload images of their clothing, and the app generates personalized outfit recommendations using generative AI. It even visualizes how outfits would look on the user — eliminating the need to try them on physically. Future iterations will include agentic AI that shops for users automatically based on their wardrobe, preferences, and lifestyle context.</p>
